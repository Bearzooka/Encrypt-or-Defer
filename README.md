# Encrypt-or-Defer
A mod of the [install-or-defer](https://github.com/homebysix/install-or-defer "install-or-defer") framework by Elliot Jordan ([homebysix](https://github.com/homebysix "homebysix")) that asks the user to reboot the machine so **FileVault** encryption can start, with the option of deferring this reboot up to 72 hours, time after which the reboot is enforced.
